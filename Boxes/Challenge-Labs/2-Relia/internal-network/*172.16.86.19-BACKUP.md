## ++ Approach ++
#### Credentials
    * amy:backups1 (move laterally)
    * andrew:Rb9kNokjDsjYyH

#### Services
    
    ##### 135 SSH
        -

### ++ System Interaction ++
#### Foothold  
	* In .15 we found a keepass file with sarah ssh key

#### Privilege Escalation 
	* With pspy we found borg passphrase and found in the sudoers the command borg. Executing `sudo /usr/bin/borg extract --stdout /opt/borgbackup/::home` we get amy hash (backups1 after crack) to move laterally and andrew credentials
    * Amy can run any command as sudo

#### Attack chain
	* Login as sarah with ssh key
    * Abuse borg command as sudo
    * Move laterally and run sudo commands as amy
	
#### Post-exploitation 
	*
