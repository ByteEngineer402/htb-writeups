#### Vuln 1:  ++
	* 

### ++ System Interaction ++
#### Foothold  
	* With AS-REP Roasting attack we found michelle credentials, who is a member of "Intranet RDP" group

#### Privilege Escalation 
	* We found C:\Scheduler\scheduler.exe binary available to dll hijacking, so we move the binary to our windows machine and analyze the binary with ProcessMonitor. We found beyondhelper.dll vulnerable so we place a .dll payload in C:\Scheduler and after restart the service we successfully get a shell as admin

#### Attack chain
	* Login as michelle after discover the crentials through AS-REP Roasting
    * Abuse scheduler.exe with dll hijacking
	
#### Post-exploitation 
	* Dump andrea credentials
