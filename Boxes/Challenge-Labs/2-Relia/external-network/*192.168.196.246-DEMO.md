### ++ Approach ++
#### Credentials
    * anita

#### Services
    
    ##### 80 HTTP
        -
    
    ##### 443 HTTPS
        -
    
    ##### 2222 SSH
        -

### ++ Vulnerabilities ++

#### Vuln 1: RCE in webapp in localhost:8000 ++
	* Through http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/?view= we can execute files

### ++ System Interaction ++
#### Foothold  
	* Reusing anita key from .245

#### Privilege Escalation 
	* We placed a shell in /dev/shm and executed through http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/?view=../../../../../dev/shm/shell.php&cmd=id to get a shell as www-data
    * www-data can run everything as sudo

#### Attack chain
	* Log in as anita with ssh key
    * After discover port 8000 in localhost, we used port forwarding with chisel to open the service in our kali machine, and then we abuse vuln 1 to get a shell as www-data
    * With www-data we can run commands as sudo
	
#### Post-exploitation 
	*
