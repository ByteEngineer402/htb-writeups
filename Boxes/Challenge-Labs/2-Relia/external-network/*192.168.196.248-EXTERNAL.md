### ++ Vulnerabilities ++

#### Vuln 1: Sensitive information in public share ++
	* After get a null session in SMB we found an username, a KeePass file and a webapp backup (port 80). The KeePass file is crackable

### ++ System Interaction ++
#### Foothold  
	* Cracking KeePass file found in SMB null session we enter with emma credentials

#### Privilege Escalation 
	* In environmental variable $Env:AppKey we found user mark and its password

#### Attack chain
	* Retrieve files from SMB, crack KeePass file and login as user emma
    * Find mark credentials and log as admin
	
#### Post-exploitation 
	* Nothing interesting here
