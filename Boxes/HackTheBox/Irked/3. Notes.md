#### ++ Lateral Movement: djmardov ++
	In user Documents folder we found a password and references to "steganography", which is a technique of hiding information in digital files
	With steghide and the big file in the http app we get djmardov password (Command: steghide extract -sf irked.jpg -p UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss)
#### ++ Priv Esc ++
	We found binary /usr/bin/viewuser while searching for SUID binaries on the system
	It was executing some commands as root but the binary failed executing /tmp/listuser (not found) so we create the file, add execution permission and get a shell as root
