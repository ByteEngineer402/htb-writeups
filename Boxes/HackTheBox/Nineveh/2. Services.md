#### 80 HTTP
	PHP Version 7.0.18-0ubuntu0.16.04.1
	Login in /department (Brute force: admin:1q2w3e4r5t)
	In notes we got LFI, but only works with files with filenames containing string "ninevehNotes"

#### 443 HTTPS
	phpLiteAdmin v1.9 webapp
	Login in /db/index.php (Brute force: password123)
	With 24044 (exploitdb) we create a database called `ninevehNotes.php` and insert a shell inside, then we get RCE in the LFI vulnerability found in Notes (port 80)
