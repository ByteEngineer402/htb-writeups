#### Foothold
- Brute force login `http://nineveh.htb/department` (`admin:1q2w3e4r5t`)
- Brute force login `https://nineveh.htb/db/index.php` (`password123`)
- Inject php code in phpLiteAdmin database by following **[this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/24044)**
- Gain RCE by triggering the php code abusing LFI in http://nineveh.htb/department/manage.php?notes=/var/tmp/ninevehNotes&cmd=id

#### Privilege escalation (abuse chkrootkit)
