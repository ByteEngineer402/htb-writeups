#### ++ INFO ++
-> We can bypass the upload function uploading other files, but a config file pops up showing an error

#### ++ Upload function not sanitized ++
	We can upload a .config file with malicious aspx code and get RCE (Found the file uploaded in Enumeration page)
	Trigger it accesing http://<IP>/uploadedFiles/web.config (Files are deleted by a cronjob, so be quick)
