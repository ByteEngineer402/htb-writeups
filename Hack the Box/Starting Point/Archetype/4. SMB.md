With smbclient we notice that anonymous user is possible so we check the folders

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.122.134/   

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        backups         Disk      
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.129.122.134 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

Checking the backups folder we can find a file called prod.dtsConfig where we find sql_svc:M3g4c0rp123 credentials. After a few more checks with smbclient we can say that there is nothing more to see in here
