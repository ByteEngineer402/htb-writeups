### FTP - Port 21
Anonymous login works and retrieve backup.zip file, but is password protected

With zip2john and john the ripper we crack the password and get md5 encrypted password for admin credentials, and after unencrypt the pass we have admin:qwerty789


### Http (Apache Server) - Port 80
We discover that sql injection is possible in the search field so with sqlmap we try a few things and we got a shell
That shell is limited so we got a reverse shell and upgrade TTY
In /var/www/html folder we found postgres:P@s5w0rd! credentials so no we can SSH


### SSH - Port 22
We discover that we can open the file pg_hba.conf with vi as root, and with GTFO bins we escalate privileges
