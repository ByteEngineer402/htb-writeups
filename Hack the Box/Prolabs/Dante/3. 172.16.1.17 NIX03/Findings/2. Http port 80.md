Here we find a zip file and a folder. In the zip file we can find that the webmin version is 1.900 (RCE vulnerability found with searchsploit) and we find **[this exploit](https://github.com/roughiz/Webmin-1.910-Exploit-Script)** but we need credentials. We try the credentials found in SMB `admin:Password6543` and we are in so we can execute the vulnerability with the exploit. We can execute a reverse shell inside the system as we have a command shell option so the exploit isn't really necessary

We are root in the system so we are done here
