We have a null session here and we get a pcap file, which we can open and scan with wireshark

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/Boxes/Dante-Prolab/10.10.110.100/172.16.1.17]
└─$ file monitor 
monitor: pcap capture file, microsecond ts (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 65535)
```

Using wireshark filter by `http.request.method == POST` we find `admin:Password6543`
