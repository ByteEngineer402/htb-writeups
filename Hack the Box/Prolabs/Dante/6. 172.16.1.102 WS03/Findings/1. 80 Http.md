We have a webapp called 'Online Marriage Registration System' and we can register an account and enter the system. We can upload a php shell instead a image when creating a registry or we can use **[this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49557)**. Upload nc binary and get a reverse shell

On windows machine we found the SeImpersonatePrivilege and the system is a Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (build above 1809) so we use PrintSpoofer (we can use RoguePotato too) and we get a shell as nt authority
