We brute force the FTP service with the credentials retrieved in 172.16.1.20 and we got a valid credentials (`dharding : WestminsterOrange5`). Here we find a note telling the user that the password has been changed by the same, but finished in another number.

After generate a wordlist and brute force SMB with crackmapexec we got the credentials (`dharding : WestminsterOrange17`). With this credentials we can connect through WinRM (5985 is open)

With evil-winrm we found a program called IObit Uninstaller (version 9.5 as History.txt file says) and changing its binary path we get a nt authority shell:

```bash
-----------------------------------------
We have to execute this through Evil-winrm. If we execute this from another site, the server won`t have access to our local machine (10.10.17.78) so we have to point to our pivoting machine
